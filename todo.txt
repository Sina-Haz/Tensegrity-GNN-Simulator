1. Need to ensure applyControl() method in transforms.py works correctly and debug if needed

2. Need to implement data preprocessing methods for working with the imported data_sets directory

3. Implement accumulated normalizer methods for GNN training

4. Once data can be pre-processed into robot states and trajectories -> write a quick training loop

5. Maybe implement state history being fed to GNN instead of just 1 state converted to a graph
